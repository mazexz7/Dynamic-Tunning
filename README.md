# Dynamic-Tunning
Donut Team thread link https://forum.donutteam.com/forum/topic/4633

**We can do great things in this game!**  
_Eg. dynamic tuning for Homer's car!_  
**_Disclaimer:_ This mod is just a concept, therefore I will release it as a "beta". I am planning to continue this as time goes on, so keep an eye on this page!**  

This mod allows for over 2,000,000,000 possible combinations of tuning with 80 parts (including stock)! I plan on adding more of them as time goes on, of course.  
Tune up Homer's car to fit your liking.  
This mod features a small variety of front & rear bumpers, sideskirts, horns & more!  
The engine sound changes when you change the engine, depending on how strong your choice is.  

## How to use:
1) Select the mod  
2) Go to settings  
3) Change the settings as desired  
4) Click "OK" to save your settings.
